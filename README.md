# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

### D1 : Use for resampling models to predict credit risk
 - an accuracy score for the model was calculated
 - a confusion matrix was generated
 - An imbalanced classififcation report was generated

 **RandomOverSampler**
  - An accuracy score for te model was calculated
  - A a confusion matrix was generated
  - An imbalanced classififcation report was generated

**SMOTE**
  - An accuracy score for te model was calculated
  - A a confusion matrix was generated
  - An imbalanced classififcation report was generated

**ClusterCentroids**
  - An accuracy score for te model was calculated
  - A a confusion matrix was generated
  - An imbalanced classififcation report was generated

  ### D2 : Use the SMOTEEN Algorithm to Prdict Credit Risk
 - an accuracy score for the model was calculated .8389
 - An imbalanced classififcation report was generated

 ### D3 : Use Ensembel Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
 - an accuracy score for the model was calculated
 - a confusion matrix was generated
 - An imbalanced classififcation report was generated
